aims-convert documentation
===========================

This is a tool for extracting information from an AIMS detailed roster. It has
been developed against rosters downloaded from easyJet's version of AIMS, so may
or may not work for non-easyJet pilots whose airlines also use AIMS.

A `web interface <https://hursts.org.uk/aims>`_ is provided for those that do
not wish to install locally. The local install provides a console script for use
on the command line and a cross platform, Tk based GUI. It also allows the
module to be used as a library.
