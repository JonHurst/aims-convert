    The input object is a 12 cell tuple with each cell containing the contents
    of a "td" from the original HTML row. The contents are in the form of a
    variable length tuple of strings since the original contents of the cells
    can be multi-line. The first and last items are empty tuples since the
    original table has empty cells at the beginning and end of each row.

    The items in the row, from index 1 to index 10 are:

    1: Date of the form "01/01/2000 Mon", which may be split over two lines at
       the space.

    2: Either:

       + An empty tuple for an unpublished duty; or

       + For all day duties, the code for the all day duty; or

       + For normal sectors, the flight number plus aircraft type in square
         brackets e.g. "1234 [320]", one for each sector in the duty; or

       + For quasi sectors, the code of the quasi sector (e.g. "ESBY", "ADTY",
         "TAXI123"), one for each quasi sector in the duty. These can be mixed
         in with normal sectors.

    3: Either:

       + For all day duties, a textual description of the duty; or

       + For sectors, the airports invloved in the form "BRS - FNC", one for
         each sector or quasi sector in the duty. For quasi sectors the two
         airports may be the same (e.g. "LGW - LGW" for a sim) or, to indicate
         postioning, may start with a "*" (e.g "*LGW - BRS" for a taxi ride).

    4: Report time. This is not necessarily duty start time -- there may be
       standby duties before report, and it is empty for standbys without a
       call out.

    5: Sector times of the form "11:00 - 13:00", one for each sector in the
       duty, including for quasi sectors. For duties that have already taken
       place, the fact that the times are actual times may be indicated with an
       "A", giving the form "A11:00 - A13:00", although this doesn't seem to be
       especially consistently done. The string for the last sector may also
       incorporate the delay in the form "A11:00 - A13:00/01:00". For an all
       day duty there are no times to record, and hence the cell will be an
       empty tuple.

    6: Duty end time. Empty for standby without callout.

    7: Block hours

    8: Duty hours

    9: Markers for memos etc.

    10: Crew list, one string per crew member. The crew is associated with the
        entire duty rather than per sector.
