This directory is for compound test files. The test files themselves are not
version controlled as they contain information that should not be made public.

To add a test file:

1. Add a downloaded HTML AIMS logbook file or HTML AIMS veritcal crew schedule
2. Add the required roster output as a file named XXXXXX.txt where XXXXXX
represents the full original filename, i.e. if the original file was named
myroster.htm, this one should be named myroster.htm.txt.
3. Similarly add required csv, ical and efj output as XXXXXX.csv, XXXXXX.ical
and XXXXXX.efj respectively.
4. Update DSTAMP and LAST-MODIFIED fields of ical to 20240101T000000Z (these
are calculated at creation time, so tests use freezegun for consistency)
